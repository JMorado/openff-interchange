    "\n",
    "The Toolkit provides a class called `Topology` which stores a system of molecules. It is similar to an `Interchange` in that it stores a list of molecules along with box vectors and some other system information, but unlike `Interchange` a topology is not associated with any force field or parameters. It provides a useful class method `from_openmm` which takes a multi-component OpenMM topology and produces the corresponding Toolkit topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because OpenMM topologies include connectivity but not the rich chemical information stored in a `Molecule`, `from_openmm` needs a list of `Molecule` objects that describe the components of the topology. This method is therefore most useful for moving a system with coordinates into the OpenFF ecosystem, and not for identifying the components themselves."

If two molecules in the list can't be distinguished in the PDB, or a molecule in the PDB can't be matched to any molecule in the list, the Toolkit raises an error that tells you there's a mistake.
