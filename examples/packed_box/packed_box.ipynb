    "\n",
    "The Toolkit provides a class called `Topology` which stores a system of molecules. It is similar to an `Interchange` in that it stores a list of molecules along with box vectors and some other system information, but unlike `Interchange` a topology is not associated with any force field or parameters. It provides a useful class method `from_openmm` which takes a multi-component OpenMM topology and produces the corresponding Toolkit topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because OpenMM topologies include connectivity but not the rich chemical information stored in a `Molecule`, `from_openmm` needs a list of `Molecule` objects that describe the components of the topology. This method is therefore most useful for moving a system with coordinates into the OpenFF ecosystem, and not for identifying the components themselves."

Box vectors, numbers of each molecule, and the ordering of atoms in the system are taken from the PDB file, but chemical identities are taken from the list. If two molecules in the list can't be distinguished in the PDB, or a molecule in the PDB can't be matched to any molecule in the list, the Toolkit raises an error that tells you there's a mistake. For a system of simple molecules like this, it's easy to specify the unique molecules with SMILES codes:"
