### Examples

**Please note that this software in an early and experimental state and unsuitable for production.**
**These notebooks are not currently guaranteed to stable or be updated with experimental API changes.**

Jupyter notebooks demonstrating use cases.

  * `SMIRNOFF_simulation.ipynb` (broken): Runs an MD simulation from a PDB file and `openff-1.0.0` ("Parsley"), mirroring a similar example in the Open Force Field Toolkit (`openff.toolkit`)
  * `smirnoff_argon.ipynb`: Loads a simple Argon topology and inspects some internal data.
  * `smirnoff_ethanol.ipynb`: Similar to above but with a more chemically complex system.
  * `optimize-with-jax.ipynb`: Run a minimal parameter optimization using JAX.
  * `parameter_replacement.ipynb`: Partially replace parameters in a parametrized system with values from a second force field.
  * `conformer_energies.ipynb`: Given a SMILES string, generate conformers and compute the single-point energy via GROMACS and OpenMM and compare to a result generated by the OpenFF toolkit.
