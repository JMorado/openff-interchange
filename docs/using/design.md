# Content of an Interchange object

An [`Interchange`](openff.interchange.components.interchange.Interchange) object stores all the information known about a system; this includes its chemistry, how that chemistry is represented by a force field, and how the system is organised in 3D space. An `Interchange` object has four components:

1. **Topology**: Stores chemical information, such as connectivity and formal charges,  independently of force field
2. **Handlers**: Maps the chemical information to force field parameters
3. **Positions**: Cartesian co-ordinates of atoms
4. **Box vectors**: Periodicity information

None are strictly required; an `Interchange` object can be constructed containing none of the above components:

```pycon

>>> from openff.interchange import Interchange
>>> empty_interchange = Interchange()
>>> empty_interchange.topology
>>> empty_interchange.handlers
{}
>>> empty_interchange.positions
>>> empty_interchange.box
```

An empty `Interchange` is not useful in itself, but a meaningful object can be
constructed programmatically by building and assigning each component
piecemeal. `Interchange` provides a broad API for automated construction which
makes construction easier and less error prone in common cases.

## Topology

The [`Interchange.topology`](openff.interchange.components.interchange.Interchange.topology)
object is intended to mirror the [`Topology`](openff.toolkit.topology.Topology)
class provided by the OpenFF Toolkit. At present, however, it serves only as a
container for a class of the same name provided by [MDTraj](mdtraj.Topology),
stored as the attribute `Interchange.topology.mdtop`.

In an upcoming release, this `Topology` model will be able to store molecules
that are rich in chemical information (atoms connected by bonds with fractional
bond orders, bond and atom stereochemistry, aromaticity, etc.) and minimal,
molecular mechanics-focused representations (particles with masses that are
connected to each other).

A topology is optional, though any conversions requiring topological information
will fail if any required data is missing.

## Handlers

This attribute is a dictionary whose keys are string
identifiers and whose values are `PotentialHandler` objects. These handlers
roughly mirror[`ParameterHandler`](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/developing.html#parameterhandler)
objects in the OpenFF Toolkit, but as a post-parameterization representation of
the force field parameters. In other words, parameter handlers are components
of a force field, and potential handlers describe how those parameters are
applied to a chemical system. (The process by which this happens
is "parameterization.")

There are three central components in each handler: topology keys, potential keys, and potentials.

Topology keys ([`TopologyKey`](openff.interchange.models.TopologyKey) object in
memory) are unique identifiers of locations in a topology. These objects do not
include physics parameters. The basic information is a tuple of atom indices,
which can be of any non-zero length. For example, a topology key describing a
torsion will have a 4-length tuple, and a topology key describing a vdW
parameter will have a 1-length tuple.

Potential keys ([`PotentialKey`](openff.interchange.models.PotentialKey) objects
in memory) are unique identifiers of physics parameters. These objects do not
know anything about the topology they are associated with. In SMIRNOFF force
fields, SMIRKS patterns uniquely identify a parameter within a parameter
handler, so (with some exceptions) that is all that is needed to construct a
potential key. For classically atom-typed force fields, a key can be
constructed using atom types or combinations thereof.

Potentials ([`Potential`](openff.interchange.components.potentials.Potential)
objects in memory) store the physics parameters that result from parameterizing
a chemical topology with a force field. These do not know anything about where
in the topology they are associated. The parameters are stored in a dictionary
attribute `.parameters` in which keys are string identifiers and values are the
parameters themselves, tagged with units.

These objects are strung together with two mappings, each stored as dictionary
attributes of a `PotentialHandler`. The `.slot_map` attribute maps segments of
a topology to the potential keys (`TopologyKey` to `PotentialKey` mapping). The
`.potentials` attribute maps the potential keys to the potentials
(`PotentialKey` to `Potential`).

Handlers are optional, though any conversions requiring force field parameters
will fail if the necessary handlers are missing.

## Positions

Particle positions are stored as a unit-tagged $N×3$ matrix, where $N$ is the
number of particles in the topology. For systems with no virtual sites, $N$ is
the number of atoms; for systems with virtual sites, $N$ is the number of atoms
plus the number of virtual sites.

Positions are represented in nanometers both internally and when reported. However, they can be set with positions of other units, and can
also be converted as desired. Internally, Interchange uses `openff-units` to
store units, but units from the `openmm.units` or `unyt` packages are also
supported.

Interchange assumes positions without units are expressed in nanometers. The
setter will immediately tag the unitless vectors with units; the internal state
always has units explicitly associated with the values.

Positions are optional, though any conversions requiring positions will fail if
they are missing.

## Box vectors

Information about the periodic box of a system is stored as a unit-tagged $3×3$ matrix, following
conventional periodic box vectors and the implementation in
[`OpenMM`](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/05_other_features.html#periodic-boundary-conditions).

Box vectors are represented with nanometers internally and when reported. However, they can be set with box vectors of other units, and can
also be converted as desired.

If box vectors are passed to the setter without tagged units, nanometers will be assumed. The setter
will immediately tag the unitless vectors with units; the internal state always has units explicitly
associated with with the values.

If a $1×3$ matrix (array) is passed to the setter, it is assumed that these values correspond to the
lengths of a rectangular unit cell ($a_x$, $b_y$, $c_z$).

Box vectors are optional; if it is `None` it is implied that the `Interchange` object represents a
non-periodic system.
